# Mean-Variance-Markowitz-model
# INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we aim to develop a brief analysis and application with 10 different assets prices with weekly observations that go from December 8th 1997 to December 28th 1998. The examination has been developed with the Weakened Mean Variance Markowitz model, highlighting the no short selling case. Subsequently to the first part of the examination, in the modelling computation we have divided the dataset in two parts: in-sample (35 observations) and out-of-sample (21 observations). The first ones have been used to observe the model while the second ones have been implemented to test the previous applied model. Furthermore, in the second part of the analysis we have inserted an additional constraint, defined as the Cardinal Constraint. This will lead us to a slight different resolution of the problem, changing the number of the assets considered in the portfolio composition. The last analysis is a comparison with the Sharpe ratio between the in-sample and the out-of-sample including and not the Cardinality Constraint.
